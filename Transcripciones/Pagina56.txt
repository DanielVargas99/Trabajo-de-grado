Chevening is the UK government’s international scholarships programme. Funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and partner organisations, we offer awards to study in the UK for one year on a fully funded master’s degree course.
Successful Chevening candidates come from a diverse range of countries and backgrounds, but they all demonstrate the passion, vision and skills needed to shape a better world.
There are many benefits to being selected, including fully funded tuition fees, access to some of the best quality education in the world, exclusive networking opportunities, and the chance to explore the UK’s diverse culture.
At the end of your scholarship, you’ll join our diverse community of over 50,000 global alumni. You’ll return home equipped with the knowledge and networks to bring your ideas to life and thrive in your career.
It doesn’t matter where you come from. It’s where you’re going that counts.

Our partners
Chevening is funded by the FCDO and partner organisations. Our partners contribute by co-sponsoring scholarships in your country/territory. Due to their generosity, there are more opportunities to study in the UK. Although you can still apply to any UK university, whether they are a partner or not, if your application is successful and you have applied to study a course supported by one of our partners, you will be automatically considered for a co-sponsored Chevening Scholarship. Find out more about our partner organisations, the areas of study they support, and why they have committed to supporting Chevening where you are.
