Full-time applicants



Our scholarships are open to all subject areas and to all candidates who apply for a new Master's or DPhil course by the relevant January admissions deadline.


Graduate application deadlineBy applying for graduate study you will automatically be considered for a Clarendon scholarship. You do not need to submit any additional documents and there are no separate scholarship application forms for Clarendon. You must apply by the relevant January deadline for your course in order to be considered. Deadline information is available on the course pages.ValueClarendon scholarships cover course fees in full.  This applies to Home and Overseas fee status students. Scholars on a full-time course will receive an annual grant for living expenses of at least the minimum Research Council doctoral stipend rate, which is normally sufficient to cover the living costs of a single student living in Oxford. In 2021-22, you should expect to receive at least £15,609.DurationClarendon scholarships are normally offered for the full period of fee liability. This is the period for which you are liable to pay course fees to the University. The fee liability page explains this in full, and also gives information about charges that may be applied after this period, known as continuation charges, which are not covered by the Clarendon Fund. In some cases the academic division has the discretion to extend your scholarship to cover an additional period of study where the course is known to require additional time. The extension period applies to living expenses only and not to any continuation charges. Scholars will be notified in their offer letter if an extension to funding is provided.Nationality or Ordinary ResidenceThere are no restrictions by nationality or country of ordinary residence. Clarendon scholars come from across the world: from the USA to Australia, Venezuela to Vietnam and from Norway to Nigeria. Level of studyAll full-time DPhil and Master’s courses are eligible, as long as you have applied by the relevant January deadline for your course. A list of all the graduate courses offered by the University of Oxford can be found on the courses page.For information for Part-time applicants please see our dedicated page.Subject areaClarendon supports scholars from across the University, with no restrictions on subject area.Other criteriaCandidates applying to start a new DPhil or Master’s course at Oxford are eligible.

This website contains a wide variety of images relating to the University’s activities. Many of those images were originally photographed or filmed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions and preventative measures that have been put in place since. The images may therefore not be representative of the current requirements and practices on campus in relation to social distancing, face covering and restricted gatherings.
